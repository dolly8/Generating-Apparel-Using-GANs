# Generating-Apparel-Using-GANs
This project aim is to generate trending designs of apparel using DCGANs.

# Dataset
I used FashionGen dataset here to generate apparels <br/>
Just go through the link : https://www.fashion-gen.com/ and download dataset from here. 
The dataste consists of approx 2 million images.

# Colab
I uploaded the data into google drive, gave the link in the Google-colab and then worked on it.

# Model
The model used here is Deep Convolutional GANs. I used pytorch library to build the model for this task.
